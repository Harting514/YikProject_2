Room1,0,0,Rey: Are you my summoner?
Room1,0,1,"Summoner: Protector of social justice! Finally, you are here!"
Room1,0,2,Rey: Tell me what happened?
Room1,0,3,"Summoner: I beg you to save Salada, Salada is a diverse world, but due to differences in various aspects, prejudice begins to produce. Everyone is gradually beginning to discriminate against each other and not unite anymore."
Room1,0,4,"Summoner: And at the same time, due to people's inaction, the dark power of discrimination has gradually grown and began to become monsters. The monster of discrimination calls itself Nefarian, and it has used discrimination as energy. Protector, you need to collect all 4 energy core to lift Nefarian's curse, and then convince the residents of Salada to eliminate prejudice and face the issue of discrimination. Only in this way can weaken Nefarian and defeat it. "

Room2,1,2,"Rey: I am Rey, the protector of social justice, I just lifted the curse of discrimination on you."
Room2,1,3,YoungMan: Jesus! How can I be cursed?
Room2,1,4,"Rey: The prejudice and discrimination deep in your heart have become monsters. In order to ensure continuous power, the monster uses the discrimination deep in your heart to impose a curse on you and become irrational."
Room2,1,5,YoungMan: Discrimination? ! I did not discriminate!
Room2,1,6,"Rey: Discrimination and prejudice are often overlooked. Just now when you were cursed to take away your sanity, I heard you say: ""Old people? They are just old stubborn ones!"" Why do you discriminate against older people?"
Room2,1,7,"YoungMan: But the old people are very stubborn, they only know that they keep the traditional way, and occupy social resources but make no contribution to society. Because of age, both physically and mentally, they can’t integrate into society."
Room2,1,8,"Rey: You are age discrimination and wrong thinking. We will all grow old over time. We cannot discriminate against the elderly. Think about it, have you really gotten to know them?"
Room2,1,9,"YoungMan: .….. I haven't talked with the elderly for too long, because the age difference prevents me from communicating with them."
Room2,1,10,"Rey: Try to think about it in another way, you and theirs are different, because people's ideas and ways of thinking are largely based on the surrounding environment. Your current living environment and the living environment of their old people have changed a lot. So sure, there will be differences in your thinking."
Room2,1,11,"Rey: But it is precisely this difference that society can make more progress, and the experience of the older generation can provide reference and help for the modern generation. Able to find problems and find good experience"
Room2,1,12,"YoungMan: … You are right! In the past, my thoughts were too narrow. I should learn more about them instead to use prejudice and discrimination against them. Thank you, Rey!"

Room3,1,6,"Rey: Discrimination and prejudice are often overlooked. Just now when you were cursed to take away your sanity, I heard you say: ""young people! None of them have experience, they only know rampage"" Why do you discriminate against younger people?"
Room3,1,7,"OldMan: This is not discrimination, it is a fact that young people have no experience and only immature! They haven't seen a big storm yet. What they do is only for passion."
Room3,1,8,"Rey: This is typical age discrimination. You are preconceived, and treat young people with incorrect prejudices."
Room3,1,9,"Rey: Think about it, the environment they are growing up in is completely different from yours then, and their ideas will definitely disagree with you. But it is precisely this difference that is an important factor in social progress."
Room3,1,10,"Rey: They need time to accumulate experience. Just like you back then, give young people some time. Chat with them and listen carefully to their thoughts. You will learn new knowledge from their thoughts."
Room3,1,11,"OldMan: Young man, your idea convinced me! I am really too stubborn! There are too many prejudices and discrimination against young people. I need to communicate more with them! Thank you, Rey"
